# Analysis of AirBnB Properties in Paris

This project involves the analysis of Airbnb properties in Paris using a dataset obtained from Inside Airbnb. The dataset encompasses various dimensions of property information including subjective (reviews, comments), objective (price per night, number of beds, bathrooms), locational (neighborhood, latitude, longitude), and host-related characteristics (superhost status, host response rate, verified identity). The analysis employs exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to comprehend variable distributions, relationships, and insights pertinent for building linear models or classifications.

### Key Steps:
1. Importing Necessary Libraries: Utilized essential libraries such as tidyverse, dplyr, GGally, leaflet, and others to facilitate data manipulation, visualization, and geospatial analysis.
2. Data Filtering: Filtered the dataset based on predefined variables essential for the analysis, ensuring relevance and focus.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to explore variables individually, encompassing dichotomous variables and continuous variables like property prices and review averages.
4. Data Visualization: Utilized histograms, box plots, and density plots to visually represent data distributions and relationships, aiding in the understanding of key insights.
5. Impact of Host Status: Investigated the influence of host status (host vs. superhost) on property ratings, potentially uncovering factors contributing to higher ratings.
6. Analysis of High Average Review Ratings: Explored properties with high average review ratings in the dataset, raising questions and insights into the underlying reasons contributing to such ratings.
   
### Purpose and Significance:
This analysis aims to provide valuable insights into Airbnb properties in Paris, shedding light on factors influencing property characteristics and ratings. By enhancing understanding through data-driven exploration, the findings generated from this analysis can inform future modeling efforts and decision-making processes related to Airbnb properties.

### Usage:
Researchers, analysts, and stakeholders interested in the Airbnb ecosystem, particularly in Paris, can leverage the insights and methodologies presented in this analysis for informed decision-making, policy formulation, and further research endeavors.

### Repository Structure:
+ Data: Contains the dataset sourced from Inside Airbnb.
+ Notebooks: Includes R markdown code detailing the analysis process, methodology, and findings.
+ Visualizations: Stores visual representations generated during the analysis, aiding in comprehension and presentation.
+ Documentation: Houses supplementary documents such as this README to provide context, instructions, and insights into the project.

### Future Directions:
Potential future directions for this project include advanced modeling techniques, predictive analytics, natural language processing, and deeper dives into specific aspects of Airbnb property dynamics in Paris. Additionally, incorporating external datasets or exploring temporal trends could further enrich the analysis and its implications.
